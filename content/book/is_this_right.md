caption: Emmalou, at 4 years old, knows how to do things not-quite-right to get some
  attention and have a good laugh. Her parents are exhausted by the end of the day
  ... and loving (almost) every minute of it. My original drawings (like in the photo)
  are being replaced by the wonderful artwork of Ariel Trenk. They look amazing so
  far!
