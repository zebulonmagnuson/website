description = "The night before your parents are going to read you a bedtime story, the Bedtime Story Fairy comes and looks inside your brain to find out what you are interested in.  Then she whispers in the parent’s ear what bedtime story you want.  When her job is done, and she goes back to the North Pole where she makes lots of books. She gives them to authors and says, “Now, this is your book.”  The Bedtime Story Fairy has written every book on this planet."
