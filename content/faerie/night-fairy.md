description = "She comes from the moon, and she appears only at night.  She is very quiet so no one will notice her.  She is secretive and only a few people have ever seen her.  She comes to bring you good dreams if you have been good.  She thinks of what you will like then touches your head with her wand so you will dream about that. If you have been naughty she will give you a bad dream.  She keeps a diary of all the naughty kids.  She visits me at night because I have lots of good dreams.  Apparently, Iâ€™m a good kid!"
