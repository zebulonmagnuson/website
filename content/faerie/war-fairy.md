description = "The War Fairy doesn’t care about anybody.  He is super mean, and he blows stuff up.  He came into being when the atomic bomb was dropped on Japan.  He’s here to remind us that humans are not perfect, and we are still capable of destruction and bad ideas.  He balances niceness with his badness."
