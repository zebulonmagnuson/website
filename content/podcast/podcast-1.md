I'm going to find the time to make short podcasts in intermediate English about innovative teaching and learning. The target language is all those folks working in international schools who are also working on improving their English listening. It's a twofer, as we say, or a two for one: some good thoughts about learning and some slower language with explanations of words and expressions that might be unfamiliar. A twofer!
