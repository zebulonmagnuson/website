    <h4>Innovative teaching and learning</h4>

    Virtual school visits with students and teachers, Student and teacher agency, teacher-directed professional development, agile in education, blogs, podcasts in intermediate English, and children's books.
    <br><br>
    I like to reflect with others about educational possibilities that are not those we encounter every day. I like to support student and teacher agency so that we might actually walk the talk of lifelong learning. And I like to read my own creative work to children, while encouraging them to draw, to write, and to imagine.
    </p>

    <h4>Projects on the front burner</h4>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Podcasts in intermediate English about innovative teaching and learning (with my colleagues in Taiwan).</li>
      <li>The February 2023 release of my fourth children's book, Is This Right? If you've ever been a parent - or a child - you'll be able to relate to Emmalou.</li>
      <li>DIY Language Curriculum - where students construct their own language to explore how cool language really is. And it really is cool.</li>
    </ul>

    You probably don’t know what I’m about to tell you.

    When you lose a tooth, the Tooth Faerie comes to your room in the middle of the night, reaches under your pillow, and takes it. In exchange, she leaves a coin in its place, for you!

    You knew that already? I did too. Everyone knows about the Tooth Faerie. Here’s what I didn’t know, though, and I bet you don’t know this either. Lean in close. I’ll whisper it to you . . .

    _The Tooth Faerie isn’t the only faerie who visits in the night._

    am committed to creating unique, scaffolded learning for non-native English speaking

    Listeners can engage with current topics in innovative teaching and learning and
    continue their English practice with additional materials on the same topic. From
    easy podcast to short blog to longer podcast. This project is a collaboration
    of colleagues working in  Switzerland and Taiwan. \n\nSeason 1 Preview\n\nEpisode
    1. Student and teacher agency\nEpisode 2. Teachers leading their own PD\nEpisode

  name: Paul Magnuson
  designation: Educator and Author
  content: "I attribute much of my innovation in teaching and learning to 20 years
    of summer camp experience. Never underestimate the power of learning when unfettered
    from “regular” school! Years of experience in school improvement with US federal
    education programs, coupled with classroom teaching from elementary through graduate
    school (e.g. world languages, ESL, music, teaching licensure, applied linguistics,
    and leadership) bring both perspective and depth.\n\nSince 2008 I’ve held several
    roles at Leysin American School, including middle school and summer school leadership,
    accreditation systems, curriculum development, and professional development through
    action research. Since 2015 I've also taught in administration, international
    education, and teacher licensure, first at Endicott College and since 2020 at
    Moreland University. \n\nI hold a PhD in Curriculum & Instruction from the University
    of Minnesota, a ScrumMaster certification in Agility, and a ten year hobby of
    language learning with Duolingo, whom I met once in person. Well, more like in
    owl, if you see what I mean."

      on your current pd efforts to further your culture of learning at school.'
